This script loads raw Samsung accelerometer data from both training and test sets from files X_test.txt and X_train.txt, and combined with activity and subject labels found in y_test.txt/y_train.txt and subject_test.txt/subject_train.txt files, respectively.

The two datasets were combined into one, and variables labelled using information provided in features.txt.

Columns representing the mean or standard deviation of each measurement were extracted from the larger dataset. Finally, the data were summarised by calculating the mean of each variable per subject and per activity.

The summarised dataset was saved as UCI_HAR_DATA_cleaned.txt.
